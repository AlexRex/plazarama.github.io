title: Environment Setup
Description: Installing the environment to start working.

Our stack of development is going to be based in the MEAN Stack without the A for Angular. This is because Angular is a hard and difficult technology to learn and we think that what gives to us is not an essential plus to add it to the equation. 

So we're going to use *Node.js, Express and MongoDB* in the backend and *HTML, CSS, Javascript(jQuery)* at the frontend. 

And for the communication between the clients we're going to use *Socket.io*.

Let's setup our environment to work with it.

#Node.js

Node.js is going to be our main platform at the server side. Download it from his site [Node.js](!https://nodejs.org/), and install it.

Open a bash and see if everything gone well trying to find the node version:
	node -v

You should see something like: *v4.2.1*. So we're in!
