In this post we will introduce the background technology involved in the project. This means: The technology which we are going to use to manage and develop the project, not the actual technology that runs the project.

##Version control: Git & Github
Git is the actual standard in distributed version control. This is easier when you see an example.


###Setup Git

Download Git: [git-scm](http://git-scm.com/)
And install it. Is recommended to let the things in the installer as defaults.

Install some Git GUI Interface for easy interaction. One of the most useds is the client from Github: [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
