We met up with fergal this week and we we really need to get more done on our project in the next 3 weeks! So it all steams ahead! Robert will be working on the login part of the page for the moment so you will be able to login through facebook. If you don't have a facebook account you will be able to log in as a guest but we are going to work on the facebook part for now. 

I also got a basic "user profile page" done this week. Its just simple as I can style it later on.
