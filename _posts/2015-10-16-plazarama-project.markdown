This is the blog por the Plazarama Project. And what is this?

Plazarama project consist in a multiplayer/multiscreen game. Is a serie of games where the users compite with each other to see which one is the better. But the interesting point is not that, because there are a lot of games like this, the interesting part is that is a multiscreen game. 


This means that the game is going to play into multiple screens, basically we have two types of screens:

* Host Screen: Where the actual game is played.

* Controller Screen: Where you can control the game. This can be your mobile phone, for example.

So, for getting you in context, we will show an example that will make a clue. 

Imagine a quiz/trivia game where do you have a panel with a question and another panel with the answers. Imagine that you want to play to another player in the same mobile phone but the screen is too small for the both, so, what would happen if you separate the question from the answers? So this is the basic idea, separating the actual game from the controller.
